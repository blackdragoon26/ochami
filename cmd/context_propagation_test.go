package cmd

// context_propagation_test.go verifies that a context set on the root Cobra
// command is wired through to the HTTP request layer. Context values and
// deadlines are local to the client and never cross the wire, so they can't
// be observed from the server side of an httptest round trip; cancellation
// is the one property that's both client-local and externally observable,
// since a cancelled context must cause the command to fail before the
// request completes against a live server. Deterministic coverage of
// cancellation/deadline handling within the client's request layer itself
// lives in pkg/client/request_layer_test.go; this test only proves the
// wiring between the command layer and the client is intact.
