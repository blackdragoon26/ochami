// testhelpers_test.go provides shared helpers for command-level (end-to-end)
// tests. These tests build the real root command tree, point commands at an
// httptest.Server via each service's --uri flag, and assert both the outbound
// request shape and the resolved process exit code (via cli.ExitCode) that the
// command's returned error maps to. Config file reading is disabled with
// --ignore-config so tests never touch a user's real configuration.
